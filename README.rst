Awesome Powerarrow theme for 3.5
================================

:Original Author: https://github.com/romockee/powerarrow

This is my fork of Romockee's Powerarrow theme, implemented
for Awesome-WM 3.5  This project is still in a stage where
40% of the widgets work and I am still working on fixing up
the libraries.


Notes
-----

You will need this updated library of "blingbling" for some
of the Awesome-WM widgets:

Lua-oocairo:
https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/lua-oocairo/

udisks-glue-git:

What works in my version: so far
------------------------

- The layout in general (powerline)
- The binary clock
- battery
- CPU widget
