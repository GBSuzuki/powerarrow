Awesome Powerarrow theme for 3.5
================================

:Original Author: https://github.com/romockee/powerarrow

This is my fork of Romockee's Powerarrow theme, implemented
for Awesome-WM 3.5  This project is still in a stage where
40% of the widgets work and I am still working on fixing up
the libraries.


Notes
-----

You will need this updated library of "blingbling" for some
of the Awesome-WM widgets:

Lua-oocairo:
https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/lua-oocairo/

udisks-glue-git:
https://github.com/fernandotcl/udisks-glue


What works in my version: so far
------------------------

- The layout in general (powerline)
- Clock
- Wireless icon and SSID name widget
- Battery
- Volume
- CPU widget
- MEM widget
- Mutt Mail widget

Some differences:
----------------

- Took out the binary clock, due to the fact that it takes me way to long to read.
- Added on a clock widget and icon
- Added a "netstat" drop down menu using the 'blingbling'
library to indicate what process are currently using the
Internet
- Volume icon instead of the core temperature.
