---------------
- wicd systray icon tucked away. (be sure to start wicd with
		'systemctl enable wicd.service'
- added wicd-gtk as a pop up menu when clicking on the net
widget (thanks danielfgray)
- reduced clutter by merging the volume systray icon into the
powerarrow space
- removed the run_once from rc.lua.
